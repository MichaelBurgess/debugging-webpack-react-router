1. Ensure node is installed and npm is available as a command
2. Clone the repo
3. run "npm install"
4. run "./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js"
5. How can I Run/Debug this in WebStorm by loading /index.html, but the URL is /home, rather than /index.html?
  * If you just try to Run/Debug by default you get "Warning: [react-router] Location "/debugging-webpack-react-router/index.html" did not match any routes"
